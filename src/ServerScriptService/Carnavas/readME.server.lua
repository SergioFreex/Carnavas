haha made you open this script for no reason :rofl:

okay but fr, if there's any bugs, glitches, or weird physics going on with the ball, let me know and ill try
my best to fix it

also, try not to tamper with any script you see (unless you're familiar with the framework which is very unlikely (no offense)) because the whole framework
relies on eachother basically so if one thing fails, then everything else does (most of the time)

to configure certain stuff that i deem that should be configured, you can go ahead and view that Configuration script

okay bye
